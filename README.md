OBJECTIVE
The main objective of this report is to present a summary statistic of the key features from the data collected based on the impact of Covid19 in New Zealand. It also demonstrates how this situation has impacted the wellbeing of New Zealanders in various domains including Finance, Social and Health. 

DATASETS CONSIDERED:
1.	Number of Covid19 cases in New Zealand
2.	Number of Covid19 cases in the rest of the world
3.	Ability to meet bills
4.	Change in income
5.	Jobs Online

PRE-PROCESSING OF THE DATASETS:
i.	Unnecessary columns (class, category, indicator_name, units, and date_updated) was not considered for the analysis.
ii.	Column names were changes according to the needs as all the data tables had the same column header.
iii.	Cleaned the format of the qualitative data to remove any symbols.
iv.	Trimmed the trailing and leading whitespaces as it caused duplicate values.
v.	Changing the datatype of the variables for quantitative computations.
vi.	Filtered and grouped to extract the required observations only.
** All of these and the rest are clearly documented in the code attached with this document.

REASON TO CHOOSE THE DATASET:
The main idea of this report is to analyse how the income and financial stability of New Zealanders has affected due to the pandemic. Being one among them, I found employment and mental health was the first thing to be affected, which in turn contributed to a huge fall in the overall economy of the country. It is a significant event that should be handled carefully as it is a high time for New Zealand to standalone with no support from its allies. 
When employment became an unanswerable question to everyone in the country, ability to manage their expenses became challenging. I strongly believe that this will have a great impact on oneâ€™s mental health. Viewing this as highly dependent events, it would make it easier for us to resolve the issue if proper relationship is found between them. This is the main reason for me to choose these datasets for my analysis.

INSIGHTS FROM THE ANALYSIS
It was very evident that, New Zealand managed to maintain a very good recovery rate although it managed to get a lot of imported cases in an attempt to bring their citizens back into the country. This is a very good sign; however, the graph for the economy sector faced a huge downfall as the rest of the world was facing the worst.
An interesting insight that I was able to extract was the how change in employability had a negative impact on the ability of the New Zealanders to pay their bills. It seems that most of them found it difficult and unstable to settle their expenses during this tough time. Also, I have implemented Machine Learning models to compare and analyse how the actual and predicted values of the Employment index over 13 years. To my surprise, the observed value was so much deviated from what was predicted to be which shows the extent of deleterious effect on the job market which has contributed to poor mental health and financial instability to most of the New Zealanders.
